## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to center both verticaly and horizontally using flexbox and grid,
but to achieve this the parent needs a height in my case i used the min-height
property on the body which is my parent container
